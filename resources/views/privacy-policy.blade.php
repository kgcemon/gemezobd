    <p>Welcome! This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Gamezo BD</strong> (referred to as “we,” “our,” or “the App”) collects, uses, and protects your information. We respect your privacy and are committed to keeping your data safe.</p>

    <h2>1. About the App</h2>
    <p>Gamezo BD is a platform where users can purchase in-game items such as diamonds, coins, and other virtual goods for <em>Free Fire</em> and other games. We are <strong>not an official partner</strong> of any game. We operate as an affiliate and reseller.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>Our app does not require registration or login. Users can order as guests. To complete and process your orders, we may collect the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Player ID / Game ID:</strong> Required only to deliver the purchased items.</li>
        <li><strong>Order details:</strong> Such as order ID, items purchased, amount, and status.</li>
        <li><strong>Payment details:</strong> To verify payments, you may need to provide a payment number (e.g., bKash, Rocket) and a transaction ID. We do not collect full bank or card details.</li>
        <li><strong>Guest unique ID:</strong> A random identifier that allows you to view your order history without registration.</li>
        <li><strong>Technical information:</strong> Such as device type, app version, crash reports, and usage logs (for improving app performance).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>

        <li>To process and deliver your orders.</li>
        <li>To allow you to view your order history as a guest.</li>
        <li>To verify payment transactions.</li>
        <li>To improve the app and fix issues.</li>
        <li>To provide customer support when you contact us.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Sharing of Information</h2>
    <p>We do not sell or trade your information. However, your data may be shared in the following cases:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>With payment verification systems to confirm transaction IDs.</li>
        <li>With affiliates or suppliers to complete your orders.</li>
        <li>With authorities if required by law or for security purposes.</li>

    <h2>9. Cookies & Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The app itself does not use cookies directly, but third-party services (if integrated) may use their own cookies or tracking tools.</p>

    <h2>10. Third-Party Links</h2>
    <p>Our app may contain links to third-party websites or services. Their privacy practices are beyond our control, and you should review their policies separately.</p>
